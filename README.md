🧿 **Iris Image Segmentation Using FCN**

This project demonstrates **Semantic segmentation** of the iris present in the eye images using the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). The U-Net Architecture is implemented that originates from FCN.
The U-Net plays a crucial role in biomedical image segmentation. It is widely used in medical imaging for detection, segmentation and identification. When labelled data is limited, U-Net can learn from fewer training examples as compared with other CNN architectures. The design of the project can be utilised to build applications such as **biometrics, iris recognition systems, eye disease detection**.

**Important Points**
- Used OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras for preprocessing and model building
- Trained and evaluated the model on real eye datasets
- Implemented FCN-based U-Net architecture for iris segmentation
- Visualised the predicted and ground truth images


**🛠️ Tech Stack**
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
 
**🧪 Results**
- Achieved **99.85%** accuracy on validation dataset with U-Net
- Output Image shows effective separation of the iris region
