🧿 **Iris Image Segmentation Using FCN**

This project demonstrates **Semantic segmentation** of the iris present in the eye images using the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). The U-Net Architecture is implemented that originates from FCN.
The U-Net plays a crucial role in biomedical image segmentation. It is widely used in medical imaging for detection, segmentation and identification. When labelled data is limited, U-Net can learn from fewer training examples as compared with other CNN architectures. The design of the project can be utilised to build applications such as **biometrics, iris recognition systems, eye disease detection**.

**Steps**
--> Used OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras for preprocessing and model building
--> Trained and evaluated the model on real eye datasets
--> Implemented FCN-based U-Net architecture for iris segmentation
--> Visualised the predicted and ground truth images


**🛠️ Tech Stack**
